# 2048

This project provides a Python implementation of the popular game 2048 along with a reinforcement learning agent trained using Q-learning. The game can be played manually or you can watch as the Q-learning agent learns to play the game on its own. The agent's performance improves over time through interactions with the environment, demonstrating the power of reinforcement learning in mastering complex tasks. Dive into the code, explore the implementation, and witness the agent's learning journey in action!
